This site is meant to announce any news connected to the [Angular Athens](https://www.meetup.com/Angular-Athens/) meetup, and any other things that might come up along the way.

It is build using Jekyll on Github Pages.

I used [this](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) guide by Jonathan McGlone, and the Github Pages [setup guide](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/).
